### Suggesting New Transforms

Transform suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues). This section guides you through submitting an issue requesting a new transform be added to the RasgoQL library, **including completely new functionality and minor improvements to existing transforms**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an request for a new transform

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.rasgoql.com) carefully and find out if the transform is already covered, maybe by an different name.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.


<!-- omit in toc -->
#### What does a good new transform suggestion look like?

- Uses a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provides a **step-by-step description of the suggested transform** in as many details as possible or includes any links to relevant examples.
- **Describes the current situation/general usecase** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots**
- **Explain why this transform would be useful** to most RasgoQL users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report includes all the evidence as if you were taking this issue to court. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://docs.rasgoql.com)). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related information, passwords, credentials, issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. You are responsible for ensuring that your issue does not contain sensitive material. This includes but is not limited to: logins, passwords, data warehouse connection information, protected data, etc. #TODO (should get cleared by a lawyer).


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be handled accordingly.


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for core RasgoQL, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Request for Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://docs.rasgoql.com) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Feel free to run it past the team first on our [slack server](#TODO)

### Your First Code Contribution ()
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch that includes a short description of your change (ie 'bigquery-support')
2. Create a branch for your edits.
3. Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, ‚ÄúCloses #37‚Äù)
2. Make sure to include all your changes in a single commit
4. Submit a pull request

The maintainers will then review the PR and notify you next steps in the PR request.
